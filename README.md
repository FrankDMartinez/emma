Election Method Mathematics Application
---------------------------------------

EMMA simulates elections using diffferent voting methods to quantitatively compare different election methods using the “Bayesian Regret” methodology.

How to Contribute
-----------------

At this stage, the most helpful way to contribute at this stage
would be to

   useful and provides extra motivation.)

The application is inspired by Warren D. Smith's `IEVS` (Infinitely Extendible Election Simulator). Initially, I had forked Warren's project to help try to make the code more readable and to verify election method simulations were implemented correctly. Over time, I found Myself more and more confused by the structure of the code to the point I felt compelled to attempt to re-write at least key parts of the application from scratch, a statement which should by no means be taken as a reflection on Warren, `IEVS`, or any other thing or Individual; it is simply the way My head works.
